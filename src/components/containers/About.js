<p>Since 1972, GM has provided leading opportunities to qualified minorities to help prepare them to
become dealers and to help them succeed once they become dealers. GM is committed to "Changing
the Face of Automotive Retail."</p>
<p>In support of this mission, the GM Minority Dealer Development (MDD) Scholarship Program is offered
to help minority students of African American, Asian, Hispanic or Native American descent, interested in
pursuing careers in automotive retail and/or automotive technology. There are many strong career
opportunities in automotive retail, and we wish to encourage students interested in pursuing these
career options.</p>
